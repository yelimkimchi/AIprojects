# AIprojects
# This is my first ML project, which classifies 28 x 28 pixel clothing item images with an accuracy of 88%. I followed the instructions from the Tensorflow tutorial 
# (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification#set_up_the_layers) and tweaked the code a little bit 
# (for example, I added another hidden layer to enhance the performance).
